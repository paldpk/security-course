# Protocol Building Blocks
A protocol is a series of steps, involving two or more parties, designed to accomplish a task.
characteristics Of protocol:

* Everyone involved in the protocol must know the protocol and all of the steps to follow in advance.
* Everyone involved in the protocol must agree to follow it.
* The protocol must be unambiguous; each step must be well defined and there must be no chance of a misunderstanding.
* The protocol must be complete; there must be a specified action for every possible situation.

# Types of Protocol
* Arbitrated Protocols
  In an Arbitrated Protocol, An arbitrator is a disinterested third party trusted to complete a protocol (see Figure 2.1a). Disinterested means that the arbitrator has no vested interest in the protocol and no particular allegiance to any of the parties involved. Trusted means that all people involved in the protocol accept what he says as true, what he does as correct, and that he will complete his part of the protocol. Arbitrators can help complete protocols between two mutually distrustful parties.
