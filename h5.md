 1. What are Honeypots?

Definition: A honeypot is a decoy system designed to lure attackers, detect unauthorized access, and study malicious activity.
Types:
Low Interaction: Basic, non-interactive, simulating limited services.
High Interaction: Fully interactive, mimicking real systems but complex to maintain.
Medium Interaction: Simpler to deploy but still valuable, e.g., displaying login prompts without allowing real access.

2 Advantages of Honeypots:

Defender Advantage: Attackers must spend resources to determine if a honeypot is real, leveraging defenders’ better understanding of their network.
High-Fidelity Alerts: Honeypots generate precise alerts only when unusual activity occurs, minimizing false positives.
Low Maintenance: Once set up, honeypots require minimal management and act as a passive detection layer.
3 Use Cases:

Ideal for internal networks, acting as early warning systems when attackers breach defenses like firewalls or endpoint detection systems.
Mimic attractive targets (e.g., outdated file shares) to deceive attackers into exposing their presence.
Complement the "assume breach" strategy, adding a defensive layer for when attackers are already inside.

4 Challenges and Deployment Tips:

Placement: Must balance visibility for attackers while avoiding interference with legitimate users.
Isolation: Ensure honeypots cannot connect outwards or be used for lateral movement if compromised.
Realism: Honeypots must appear legitimate to attackers without being too obvious.
5 Empirical Evidence:
Research shows attackers who know about deception technologies experience higher stress and second-guess their actions, which can slow down their attack progression.

6 Practical Tools:
Open-source solutions like OpenCanary offer accessible options for medium-interaction honeypots.
Commercial and bundled security products often include honeypots as part of broader solutions.

Honeypots are like fire alarms or car alarms: they don’t stop the threat but alert defenders to react promptly.

# I’m a script kiddie, bypassing your antivirus software - Helsec Meetup May 2023

The presentation offers a detailed account of a beginner's exploration into malware development, emphasizing both the challenges and the lessons learned. Here's a summary:


1 Research:

* Explored malware types and basic functionalities.
* Identified DLL side-loading as a feasible method for the project:
  * Exploits Windows behavior of prioritizing local DLLs in the program's folder.
  * Utilizes a malicious DLL to hijack legitimate processes.

2 Development:
Learned C++ for crafting the DLL, combining code snippets from tutorials.
Relied on existing guides, like:
Dominic's tutorial (general malware crafting).
CryptoAce's blog (choosing exploitable software).
Implemented antivirus evasion using simple delays to bypass detection.

3 Execution & Payload:

Created a phishing scenario where users downloaded a malicious "PDF."
Malicious DLL redirected legitimate software to its needs while executing malicious code.
Established a connection to the attacker's server using the Sliver framework, enabling remote operations like taking screenshots.

Results
Successfully bypassed antivirus detection during testing.
Demonstrated the ease with which even an amateur could craft functional malware, highlighting the need for robust cybersecurity layers.

Lessons Learned
1 Cybersecurity Awareness:
 * Antivirus alone is insufficient; layered security is crucial.
2 Operational Security (OpSec):
 * Avoid leaving identifiable traces in metadata (e.g., the author's real name was embedded in the malware).
3 Value of Defensive Insights:
 * Collaborating with security operations teams offered a deeper understanding of defense mechanisms.
