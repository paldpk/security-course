# x) Read and summarize
1 Introduction
* The current internet-based commerce system relies heavily on financial institutions as trusted third parties to process payments, which introduces limitations. These include higher transaction costs due to dispute mediation, making small transactions impractical, and risks of fraud that require merchants to demand more customer information.
* The trust-based model prevents non-reversible transactions and incurs inefficiencies.
* A proposed alternative is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof rather than trust.
* This system would enable direct transactions between parties without intermediaries, protect sellers from fraud through irreversible transactions, and use peer-to-peer distributed timestamp servers to solve the double-spending problem.
* The system's security depends on honest nodes controlling the majority of computing power.

2 Transactions
  * An electronic coin is a chain of digital signatures, where ownership is transferred by signing a hash of the previous transaction and the recipient's public key, allowing verification of ownership through the signature chain.
  * Transactions must be publicly announced, and participants need a system to agree on a single transaction history. Proof of majority agreement at the time of each transaction ensures authenticity without relying on a trusted central party.

3 Timestamp Server
*  A timestamp server  hashes a block of items and publicly publishes it, proving the data's existence at a specific time. Each timestamp incorporates the previous one, creating a chain where each new timestamp reinforces the integrity of the prior ones.

4 Proof-of-Work
* A proof-of-work system, inspired by Hashcash, requires finding a nonce such that the hash of a block starts with a specific number of zero bits. This process ensures computational effort.
* Once a block satisfies the proof-of-work, it cannot be altered without redoing the work, including all subsequent blocks in the chain, securing the data.
* Proof-of-work ensures majority representation through computational power (one-CPU-one-vote) rather than IP addresses, with the longest chain reflecting the most invested effort.
*  Modifying a block requires redoing the proof-of-work for that block and all following blocks, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to catch up to the honest chain.
*  The system adjusts proof-of-work difficulty based on a moving average to maintain a consistent block generation rate, accommodating hardware advancements and node participation changes.

5 Network
* New transactions are broadcast to all nodes, collected into blocks, and nodes work to find proof-of-work for their block. Once found, the block is broadcast and validated by nodes.
* Nodes accept blocks only if all transactions are valid and not spent, then begin creating the next block using the hash of the accepted block.
* Nodes prioritize extending the longest chain as the correct version, switching to it if a tie is resolved by a longer branch.
* Transactions and blocks tolerate message drops; nodes missing a block will request it later to maintain synchronization.
  
6 Incentive
* The first transaction in a block creates new coins for the block creator, incentivizing node support and facilitating initial coin distribution without a central authority.
* Like gold mining, creating coins requires expending resources (CPU time and electricity), linking coin issuance to computational effort.
* Over time, as coin issuance decreases, incentives will shift to transaction fees, allowing the system to become inflation-free
* The incentive structure makes it more profitable for nodes, including potential attackers, to follow the rules rather than attempt fraud, promoting network integrity.

f) Rogecoin
The video satirizes cryptocurrency investments, using exaggerated humor to critique various aspects of the industry. Key arguments include:
* Environmental Impact: It highlights the high energy consumption associated with mining cryptocurrencies, likening it to the energy use of entire nations.
* Volatility and Speculation: The video mocks the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, pointing out how values can plummet due to minor events, like tweets or regulatory actions.
* Lack of Practical Use: Cryptocurrencies are presented as impractical for everyday transactions, with usage limited to niche or illicit activities.
* Risk of Scams and Loss: It emphasizes the risks of scams, hacking, and lost wallets, portraying cryptocurrency as insecure for inexperienced users.

Critique
While the satire effectively underscores genuine issues—such as environmental concerns, speculative risks, and limited adoption—it oversimplifies the technology's potential benefits (e.g., decentralization or financial inclusion). The humor may alienate those who see legitimate value in blockchain innovations, reducing nuanced debate to mockery. However, it succeeds in warning against blind trust in trends or influencers promoting financial risks.
