# Cyber kill Chain analysis summary
 Malicious users have targeted global networks from the beginning, initially through self-propagating code like viruses and worms.
 Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), focused on data theft for economic or military gain, are now one of the largest risks, especially in certain industries.
 Traditional cybersecurity defenses like anti-virus and firewalls are insufficient against APTs, as they assume threats are automated and fixable.
 APT actors leverage sophisticated tools, zero-day exploits, and customized malware that traditional defenses can’t detect, maintaining prolonged access.
 To combat APTs, a "kill chain" framework is proposed to analyze and disrupt the sequential stages of an attack.
# Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense
This strategy focuses on understanding adversaries—analyzing their capabilities, objectives, methods, and limitations—to address cyber risks effectively.
It involves a continuous process of using indicators from past intrusions to detect and analyze new threats, treating intrusions as multi-phase events rather than isolated incidents.
The kill chain model segments intrusions into phases, allowing defenders to disrupt any stage to thwart adversaries and prevent them from reaching their objectives
This model increases the cost and difficulty for attackers, showing that defenders, with proactive intelligence, can hold an advantage over persistent threats.
