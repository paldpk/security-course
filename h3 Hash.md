OONE-WAY HASH FUNCTIONS
* One-way functions are relatively easy to compute, but significantly harder to reverse. That is, given x it is easy to compute f(x), but given f(x) it is hard to compute x.
* They are not reversible that is one cannot get the input from the hashed output.
* A hash function is a function, mathematical or otherwise, that takes a variable-length input string (called a pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length (generally smaller) output string (called a hash value). A simple hash function would be a function that takes pre-image and returns a byte consisting of the XOR of all the input bytes.
* A good one-way hash function is also collision-free: It is hard to generate two pre-images with the same hash value.
