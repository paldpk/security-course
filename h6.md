# x) Read and summarize 
Tor: The second-generation onion router.
 -  Design goals and assumptions
   * Tor aims to protect user anonymity by preventing attackers from correlating communication partners or identifying and linking multiple communications to or from a single user.
   *  Tor's development has been shaped by various considerations, including Deployability, Usability, Flexibility,Simple design and ensuring the system remains robust under diverse operational scenarios.
   *  
In favoring simple, deployable designs, we have explicitly deferred several possible goals, either because they are solved
elsewhere, or because they are not yet solved.
* Its Not peer-to-peer
* Not secure against end-to-end attacks
* No protocol normalization

 De-anonymisation attacks on tor: A survey. 
*  Anonymity networks like Tor are increasingly popular for protecting online privacy, but their misuse for illegal activities has drawn the attention of governments and law enforcement agencies, who seek ways to de-anonymize users and disrupt the network.
*  Online anonymity systems, such as Tor, have evolved to address privacy concerns, particularly for individuals in oppressive regimes, whistleblowers, and sensitive communications. While Tor remains the most popular low-latency anonymity network, its open accessibility has made it a tool for both legitimate privacy protection and criminal misuse, prompting government and law enforcement efforts to de-anonymize its users and services.

PhishSticks - The Ethical Hackers tool for BadUSB 
* Fictional Cybersecurity Scenario: The video narrates a fictional story where an ethical hacker, Steve, demonstrates a "Bad USB" attack using a device called "Phish stick," which functions as a malicious USB dropper paired with a keylogger payload. When plugged into a target computer, it captures sensitive credentials, stores them locally, and sends them to the attacker via HTTP, showcasing the risks of such attacks.
* Key Takeaways and Awareness: The video highlights the severe consequences of falling victim to such attacks, including monetary losses and legal implications for organizations, while promoting awareness about cybersecurity threats and offering resources for defense against USB-based exploits.
