Tor: The second-generation onion router.
 -  Design goals and assumptions
   * Tor aims to protect user anonymity by preventing attackers from correlating communication partners or identifying and linking multiple communications to or from a single user.
   *  Tor's development has been shaped by various considerations, including Deployability, Usability, Flexibility,Simple design and ensuring the system remains robust under diverse operational scenarios.
In favoring simple, deployable designs, we have explicitly deferred several possible goals, either because they are solved
elsewhere, or because they are not yet solved.
* Its Not peer-to-peer
* Not secure against end-to-end attacks
* No protocol normalization

 De-anonymisation attacks on tor: A survey. 
*  Anonymity networks like Tor are increasingly popular for protecting online privacy, but their misuse for illegal activities has drawn the attention of governments and law enforcement agencies, who seek ways to de-anonymize users and disrupt the network.
*  Online anonymity systems, such as Tor, have evolved to address privacy concerns, particularly for individuals in oppressive regimes, whistleblowers, and sensitive communications. While Tor remains the most popular low-latency anonymity network, its open accessibility has made it a tool for both legitimate privacy protection and criminal misuse, prompting government and law enforcement efforts to de-anonymize its users and services.
* Tor, a leading anonymity network, uses onion routing to anonymize user connections through an overlay network built on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Circuits generally consist of three voluntary relays (entry, middle, and exit nodes) to route user traffic securely from the client to the destination.
* The Onion Proxy (OP) is a local software installed on a user’s device to manage Tor connections, while Directory Servers (DS) are trusted servers that maintain information about available relays, facilitating circuit establishment and communication within the Tor network.

 Some of the key components in tor are as follows
 * Onion Proxy (OP): This is a small piece of local software that needs to be installed on the user’s device.
 * Directory Servers (DS): These are a small set of trusted and known servers in the network that actively keep details about the status of the complete network.
 * Entry Node/Guard: This is the relay in the Tor network that the client directly connects to, and hence, it knows the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the client.
 * Exit Node: This is the final hop of the Tor circuit. Therefore, it knows the IP address of the destination server accessed via the Tor network.
 * Hidden Services (HS): By default, Tor provides anonymity to the user but does not hide the identity of the website that the user is accessing. An entity with access to traffic at 
 the exit node of the Tor circuit or the link between the exit node and the website can retrieve the website’s IP address. The Tor network supports Hidden Services (HS), also known 
 Onion Services, to address this issue
* Introduction Points: These are random nodes selected by the HS to register its services with the Tor network. To avoid any impact from possible Denial of Service (DOS) attacks against a single introduction point, the HS usually selects several of them.
* Rendezvous Points (RPs): This is a random Tor node selected by the client OP before the client initialises a connection with any of the introduction points advertised by the DS.
* Bridges: As DSs maintain a list of relays in the Tor network to advertise to all clients, this information could easily be used by a service provider to censor and block the Tor network. To mitigate this issue, bridges were introduced
* 

Taxonomy for tor attacks
<img width="765" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/965b258f-1132-4095-aea1-a5f2da2ef296">
* The proposed taxonomy categorizes Tor attacks into four primary types based on the adversary's objectives: de-anonymization, network disruption, censorship, and generic attacks. Each category is further divided by the targeted component of the Tor network, with the final level distinguishing attacks by methodology (active or passive).
*  De-anonymization Attacks: These attacks focus on either linking a client’s IP address to the websites they visit via Tor (e.g., for law enforcement investigations) or uncovering the real IP address of a hidden service (HS) protected by Tor’s anonymity.
*  Network disruption attacks aim to make Tor unavailable to users, often through denial-of-service (DOS) methods, while censorship attacks target Tor's ability to bypass restrictions, particularly in oppressive regimes, by blocking access to its unadvertised relays (bridges).

PhishSticks - The Ethical Hackers tool for BadUSB 
* Fictional Cybersecurity Scenario: The video narrates a fictional story where an ethical hacker, Steve, demonstrates a "Bad USB" attack using a device called "Phish stick," which functions as a malicious USB dropper paired with a keylogger payload. When plugged into a target computer, it captures sensitive credentials, stores them locally, and sends them to the attacker via HTTP, showcasing the risks of such attacks.
* Key Takeaways and Awareness: The video highlights the severe consequences of falling victim to such attacks, including monetary losses and legal implications for organizations, while promoting awareness about cybersecurity threats and offering resources for defense against USB-based exploits.
